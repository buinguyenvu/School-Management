# School-Management
This project is an assignment of Programming Fundamental which is written by me in C++ in about 4-5 days.\
All the assignment's requirements are in **school_management.pdf**. To run the program, follow the **README.txt**.All completed functions are listed in **Group_2_1552423_report.pdf**\
In the short period of time, I solve it with the easiest solution at the first though:
+ Saving data into files, which makes me more pain than using database. At that time, I do not have any concept of using database.
+ Do not think of code reuse.
+ Writing ugly functions with the tab of 7
